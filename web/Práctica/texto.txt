Hi All:

We have tried to get in contact with Marta Gonçalves on-site, to address the situation, but with no success so far.

The data from the property owner we had is 
MICHAEL SAVAIANO
Agent of Property Owner
+1 310-659-0749

But he is not attending to our calls neither.

The link is being cut by Lumen if we don’t progress on this.

Thnks.

Hi Luis,

Please, we need customer confirmation that they will grant the access to the site for Lumen. Otherwise, the order will be cancelled.

Hi Team:

Have you been able to speak to the customer on-site? We need to unlock the accesses.

For NAPA, as said earlier, we need you to get in contact with the end customer and tell them to let the team access to do the works when they contact them.

Please clarify if they can attend.

Regards.
